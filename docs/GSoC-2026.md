# GSoC 2026 Scope and Delivery Guide

## Purpose

This document defines scope, constraints, and evaluation criteria for GSoC 2026
contributions in `MUIOGO`.

## Project objective

Deliver a maintainable, platform-independent integration path for OG-Core and
OSeMOSYS workflows in this downstream repository.

## Repository boundary

- `MUIOGO` is downstream and operationally separate from `OSeMOSYS/MUIO`.
- Work in this repository must remain deliverable without upstream dependencies.
- Contributing to upstream is welcome, but it is optional and cannot be assumed.
- `MUIO-Mac` exists as a separate port effort; a target outcome is that `MUIOGO`
  becomes sufficiently platform independent that a separate port is unnecessary.

## Roles and workstreams

### Contributor role: Modeling and integration workflow

Typical focus:
- model orchestration,
- data exchange,
- run reproducibility,
- validation and logging.

### Contributor role: UI and software engineering

Typical focus:
- user workflow clarity,
- API/interface decoupling,
- cross-platform setup and runtime consistency,
- maintainability improvements.

## Non-goals

- Large rewrite without approved issue and acceptance criteria.
- Work that depends on upstream timeline or maintainer decisions.
- Introducing parallel duplicated architectures without migration plan.

## Milestones

### Community bonding

- Environment setup validated.
- Scope confirmed with linked issues.
- Technical design notes posted in issues.

### Midterm checkpoint

- Core implementation in progress and reviewable.
- At least one end-to-end workflow demonstrated.
- Risks and blockers documented with mitigation plan.

### Final checkpoint

- Scope issues closed or explicitly deferred.
- Documentation updated and complete.
- Reproducible verification steps included.

## Evaluation criteria

1. Delivery against issue acceptance criteria.
2. Code quality and maintainability.
3. Reproducibility across supported platforms.
4. Documentation quality and completeness.
5. Responsiveness to review feedback.
