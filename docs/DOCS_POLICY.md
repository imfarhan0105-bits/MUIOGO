# Documentation Policy

## Goal

Keep project documentation complete, clear, and low-overhead.

## Canonical documentation location

Canonical contributor and governance documentation lives in the repository:

- `README.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `docs/GSoC-2026.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
- `.github/pull_request_template.md`

These files are versioned, reviewable via PR, and tied to code changes.

## Wiki policy

The repository wiki is allowed for high-level background context only.

Use the wiki for:
- narrative overview,
- non-normative program context.

Do not use the wiki for:
- setup instructions,
- contribution workflow,
- architecture source of truth,
- scope/evaluation rules.

If wiki content conflicts with repository docs, repository docs are authoritative.

## Update policy

- Any setup/workflow/architecture change requires matching doc updates in the same PR.
- Cross-references should be kept current and minimal.
