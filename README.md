# Modelling User Interface for OG-Core & OSeMOSYS (MUIOGO)

This project will integrate two open-source policy modeling frameworks—CLEWS (Climate, Land, Energy, Water Systems) and OG-Core (Overlapping Generations)—into a single, end-to-end decision-support tool for sustainable development planning.

By linking sectoral resource systems (climate, land, energy, and water) with a dynamic macroeconomic model, the unified framework will allow policymakers to assess both the physical feasibility and economy-wide impacts of climate and development policies in a transparent, reproducible, and low-cost way.

Led by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), these open-source tools have already been applied in more than 20 countries —particularly in Small Island Developing States, Land-Locked Countries, and Least Developed Countries— to support policies related to Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), climate adaptation, social protection, and fiscal sustainability:
- CLEWS, built on OSeMOSYS, analyzes interactions and trade-offs across land, energy, and water systems under climate scenarios.
- OG-Core is a dynamic overlapping-generations macroeconomic model that evaluates long-term fiscal, demographic, and economic policies.

The project will create a standardized interface and shared execution system linking the two models, enabling integrated analyses that are not currently possible. The enhanced OG–CLEWS framework will be deployed in more than 10 countries, supporting evidence-based policymaking and helping countries advance toward their Sustainable Development Goals through 2030.
